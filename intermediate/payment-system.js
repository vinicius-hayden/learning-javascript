// A store sells its products in the input system plus two installments, the input being
// greater than or equal to the two installments, which must be equal, whole and as large as possible.
// For example, if the value of the goods is R$ 270.00, the down payment and the two installments are equal to R$ 90.00; 
// if the value of the goods is BRL 302.75, the down payment is BRL 102.75 and the two installments are equal to BRL 100.00. 
//Write a program that receives the value of the merchandise and provides the value of the entry and the two installments, 
//according to the rules above. 
// Note that a justification for the adoption of this rule is that it facilitates the preparation and consequent payment of 
// the slips of the two installments.

// Entrada pode ser maior ou igual às duas prestações.
// As prestações tem que ser iguais umas às outras, maiores possíveis e INTEIRAS.
